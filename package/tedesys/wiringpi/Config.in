          WiringPi is a GPIO access library written in C for the
          BCM2835 used in the Raspberry Pi. It’s released under the
          GNU LGPLv3 license and is usable from C and C++ and many
          other languages with suitable wrappers (See below) It’s
          designed to be familiar to people who have used the
          Arduino “wiring” system
